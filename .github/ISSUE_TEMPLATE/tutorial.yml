        ## Pricing the Task

        - This issue template is preconfigured to set the `Priority: 3 (High)` and `Time: <1 Hour` labels as if you were a repository maintainer. 
        - With the example `Time` and `Priority` label you can see the bot assist you with pricing the issue once it is posted. 
        - The bot automatically calculates the price based on a configurable lookup table.
